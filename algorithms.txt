Part 1

Computability Theory
What functions are computable?

What is an Algorithm?
The process by which input (ingredients) gets turned into output (cake) by
the hardware (baker, oven, etc) (e.g. a recipie)

Level of detail is very important when it comes to an algorithm's
elementary instructions
No ambiguities or fuzzy phrases
An algorithm is an ordered set of unambiguous finitely executable steps that
defines a terminating process (course book definition)

Part 2

Proof by contradiction
Prove P by proving that -P is a contradiction
Reasoning by cases

Intractable Class NP
Tractable Class P
Computational Complexity Theory

Algorithmic problem: (Searching in sorted lists)
T(n) is O(f(n)) if T(n) < k x f(n) for some k, for all n > n0
Binary search, divide and conquer
Class P of Computational Problems
Polynomial time algorithm (O(p(N))), where p is a polynomial function)

Class NP
SAT Problem
