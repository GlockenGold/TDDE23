Computer networking part 2
TCP bytestream, UDP packets
TCP Transport Control Protocol
Reliable transport between sending and recieving process
flow control: sender won't overwhelm the reciever
congestion control: throttle sender when network overloaded
higher overhead

UDP User Datagram Protocol
Unreliable data transfer between sending and receiving process
Does not provide reliablity flow control, congestion control, etc
No encryption
low overhead, good for query/response and multimedia

TCP for things that don't allow packet loss
UDP for things that need to be fast but doesn't necessarily need the every packet

SSL/TLS
provides encrypted TCP
End-point auth

non-persistent HTTP
at most one object sent over TCP, connection then closed
Downloading multiple objects requires multiple connections

FTP File Transfer Protocol

DNS Domain Name System
IP address - used for addresing datagrams
Name, e.g., www.yahoo.com - used by humans.
Uses UDP, things might get lost, but at least it's faster
