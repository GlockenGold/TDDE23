## Computational Complexity Theory
  * Intractable solutions, Class NP, non-deterministic polynomial
  * Tractable solutions, Class P, polynomial

## Traveling Salesman Problem
  * The Traveling Salesman Problem is one of the most intensively studied problems in computational mathematics
  * A traveling salesman has n number of cities to visit. He wants to know the shortest route which will allow him to visit all cities one time and return to his starting point
  * Solving this problem becomes much harder as the number of cities increases: the figure on the slide shows the solution for the 13,509 cities and
    towns in the US with more than 500 inhabitants
  * The TSP problem is in the complexity class NP-Complete
***
  * Suppose there are n cities to visit.
  * The number of possible itineraries is (n-1)!
    * for n= 10 cities, there are 9! = 362880 itineraries
  * What if n=40? For brute force methods:
    * There are now 39! itineraries to check which is greater than 10⁴⁵
    * Examining 10¹⁵ tours per second, the required time would be several billion lifetimes of the universe (~13.8 billion years old)
    * In fact, no supercomputer, existing or projected can run this fast
  * Current record 85,900 cities
  * (n-1)! grows faster than 2^n.

## Sequential search: Telephone Book
  * Suppose a telephone book has N=1000000 entries
  * Given the name Y, search for Y's telephone number
  * Worst case, 1000000 comparisons may have to be made
  * Call the algorithm A. We say it has a worst case running time which is on the order of N.
  * A runs in time 0(N) in the worst case, where N is the number of entries in the telephone book
    * Worst case behaviour is linear
***
## Big-O Notation
  * We do not care whether the algorithm takes N, 3N, 100N, or even a faction of N: N/6
    * The only thing that matters is that the running time of the algorithm grows linearly with N
    * In other words, there is some constant k such that the algorithm runs in time that is no more than k x N in the worst case
  * Asymptotic Analysis
    * T(n) is 0(f(n)) if T(n) < k x f(n) for some k, for all n > n0
***
## Binary Search: Telephone Book
  * Worst case O(log n)
  * Average O(log n)
  * Best O(1)
  * Much faster than Sequential Search, because logarithmic growth is much slower than linear growth
  * Example: Length n=20, Number of Comparisons = 5

## The Class P of Computational Problems
  * A function f(N) is said to be bounded from above by another function g(N), if for all N from a certain point on, f(N) is no greater than g(N)
    * log2 N is bounded by N
    * N x log2 N is bounded by N²
    * 2^N is bounded by N!
    * N! is bounded by N^N
  * For our purposes a polynomial function of N is one that is bounded from above by N^K for some fixed K
    * All other functions are super polynomial (exponential)
  * An algorithm whose order-of-magnitude time performance is bounded from above by a polynomial function of N, where N is the size of its inputs, is called a polynomial time algorithm (O(p(N)), where p is a polynomial function)
***
## The Class NP of Computational Problems
  * Most exponential time algorithms are merely variations on exhaustive search.
    * Generate and test
    * Incrementally generate a partial solution and backtrack
  * Some examples of problems:
    * Traveling Salesman problem
    * Shortest path problem
    * 3-colouring map problem
    * is there a Hamiltonian path in a graph
    * Satisfiability problem
      * Find a truth assignment that satisfies a sentence in the propositional calculus
      * existing algorithms are exponential in the size of the input formula
      * But, if one has a truth assignment for a formula, certifying that it is in fact a valid truth assignment can be checked in polynomial time
