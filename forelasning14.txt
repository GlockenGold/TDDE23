Every integer greater than 1 is either a prime number or the product
of prime numbers. (also called the unique prime factorization theorem)

Testing whether a number is Prime so now known to be in P
Generating the prime factorization of a compoisite number is currently in NP

Cryptography
Two procedures of interest:
M* = encode(M)
M = decode(M*)

Public-Key Cryptography

Highest RSA number factored on a classical computer was RSA-768, which is a 232 digit
semi-prime (768 bits), and took two years to compute (from 2007 to 2009)
