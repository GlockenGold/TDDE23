## TCP
  * Reliable Transport between sending and receiving process
  * Flow Control: Sender won't overwhelm receiver
  * Congestion Control: throttle sender when network overloaded
  * Does not provide: timing, minimum throughput guarantee, security
  * Connection-oriented: setup required between client and server processes
## UDP
  * Unreliable data transfer between sending and receiving process
  * Does not provide: Reliability, flow control, congestion control, timing, throughput
  guarantee, security, or connection setup
